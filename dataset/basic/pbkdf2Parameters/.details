Library - Node.js Crypto
Correctedpbkdf2 - pbkdf2 function called securely with random salt, large iteration count (>= 10000), and strong hashing algorithm
pbkdf2Parameters1 - static salt is insecure
pbkdf2Parameters2 - too small numbers of iterations should be at least 10,0000
pbkdf2Parameters3 - 'sha-1' insecure hashing algorithm
